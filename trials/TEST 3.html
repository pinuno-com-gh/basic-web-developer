    <p>Considering the merit and demerit of all the website in the iframe, we can first look at what a good website constitue of, a good website should have the following deployed within the contents of the website.
                     <br> we can talk of the following, firstly;<br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A good website should at all time open to business 7 days within a week and 365 days in a year in other to serve customers at all times where ever, of which these website is. <br> Next to look out for is that the website should showcase it works talk of what the business does, which people makes up the company, also their routin of work with images for proof, but then i see on the header "what we do" which is good.</li>
                           <p> <li> Secondly a good website should have good customer satifaction, good customer satifaction is in realtion to satisfaction in terms of customer care. keeping online help, FAQ and other important information which is helpful to customers, i think this website makes customersatifaction key</li></p>
 
                          <li>The third thing to also consider is that this website is dynamic, means from the source code people can see the webpage differently depending on the following </li>
    
                         <ol> 
                           <li>The device that the user is using, whether mobile phone or computer</li>
                           <li>The type of operating system and browser being used by the user </li>
                          <li>The source location that referred the visitor</li>
                           <li>Finally, the geographical location of the user will influence his/her language </li>
                          </ol>
                           <p> And clearly without doubt, the website  has being able to fulfil these requirment which makes it a good website, it has broken language barries by including three differents languages which makes it easy for anyone irrespective of location to visit the websit.</p>
                        </ul></p>

                <iframe  width="900" height="500" src="http://dev.pinuno.com.gh/">
                <p> this browser deos not support iframe</p>
                </iframe>
                 <p> Also from careful observation  of <a href="http://www.dev.pinuno.com.gh">www.dev.pinuno.com.gh</a> i can conclude on these merit and demerit, first to talk of is that dev.pinuno.com.gh is a website under development, <br>development website meaning that this site is under construction, it can change anytime anyday since it is still being developed, every website should follow a set of standarad format,
                       the most important ones to find on the page includes
	            <ul>
	                <li> HOME</li>
	                <li> ABOUT</li>
	                <LI> GALLERY</LI>
	                <li> SERVICES</li>
	                <li> CONTACT</li>
	            </ul>
	                <p> These things are vital and must appear on every good webpage and these website clearly contains all the basic and important forms and pages that every good business website should possess, we realize that this website contains a header which has the website <br> 
	                   <ol>
	                       <li> contact</li>
	                       <li> About</li>
	                       <li> what we do</li>
	                    </ol>
						
	                  <p>Also a good business website should be Dynamic, Dynamic in the sense that the website should be able to display differents content to the user,basesd on some of these parameters
	                     <ul number>
	                         <li>What operating system or browser the visitor is using.</li>
	                         <li>Whether the user is using a computer or a mobile device.</li>
	                         <li>The source location that referred the visitor.</li>
	                         <li>If the visitor has done a purchase before from an online shop, etc.</li>
	                     </ul> 
	                        <br> DYNAMIC website is the latest trend used for developing a website/webpage for public consumption,
                            users might visit your site with a computer, a mobile phone, with a different browser and he/she should be able to access your website. looking at <strong>www.dev.pinuno.com.gh</strong>  is a website that is Dynamic in it sense which is good for a business, i tried to log in to these site with a mobile phone and was accessible without any problem. That is what we simply mean by dynamesim.<br>

							  <p>the first website in the iframe, www.pinuno.nl contains a header </p>
                         <iframe src="http://www.pinuno.com.gh" width="900" height="500"> this is </iframe>
                         <p>  The website <a href="htttp://www.pinuno.com.gh">www.pinuno.com.gh</a> is a site that almost satisfies most of the requirment of a business website, particular it is a simply website,it contians both footer and header,<br> it also have links on the header describing what is does as a business, but
                             each link do not respond to a click with the mouse, which indicate that this website is a <em>static</em> website.
                             we say a site is static when the information is displayed within the same page of the site beside, it usually written in plain HTML and what is in the code of the page is what is displayed to the user. Which makese it sometimes easier to develop. <br> but it requires expect to update it contents,
