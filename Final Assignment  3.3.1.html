	<div style="background-color:lightblue"> Considering the merit and demerit of all the website in the iframe, we can first look at what a good website constitue of, a good website should have the following deployed within the contents of the website.</p>
			 we can talk of the following, firstly;
				<ul>
					<li>A good website should at all time open to business 7 days within a week and 365 days in a year in other to serve customers at all times where ever, of which these website is. <br> Next to look out for is that the website should showcase it works talk of what the business does, which people makes up the company, also their routin of work with images for proof, but then i see on the header "what we do" which is good.</li>
					<p> <li> Secondly a good website should have good customer satifaction, good customer satifaction is in relation to satisfaction in terms of customer care. keeping online help, FAQ and other important information which is helpful to customers, i think this website makes customer satifaction keen</li></p>
					<li>The third thing to also consider is that this website is dynamic, means from the source code people can see the webpage differently depending on the following </li>
						<ol> 
							<li>The device that the user is using, whether mobile phone or a computer</li>
							<li>The type of operating system and browser being used by the user </li>
							<li>The source location that referred the visitor</li>
							<li>Finally, the geographical location of the user will influence his/her language </li>
						</ol>
				   <p> And clearly without doubt, the website  has being able to fulfil these requirement which makes it a good website, it has broken language barries by including three different languages which makes it easy for anyone irrespective of location to visit the website/webpage.</p>
				</ul> 
				One should bear in mind that, there are also few skills required that must be met to have and create a simple website<br>
				1. computer operation - one should able to operate a basic computer, which in this case may comprise of creating file, deleting file, updating file, directory creation and file permission <br>
				2. Remote access - one should be able to connect computers across the network, because web server wil be accessed from remote site only<br>
				3. file upload and download -  because your webserver will be on a remote site, you will have to upload files related to your website <br>
				4. knownledge in HTML - These are markup languages used to build a website, 
		     <!--BAD, such long paragraphs with nested elements and other paragraphs is not good for readability of code and formating as well. Redo this section properly closing tags and applying xhtml standards -->

	</div>
	<div class="column" style="background-color:lightblue">
		<p> Also from careful observation  of <a href="http://dev.pinuno.com.gh">dev.pinuno.com.gh</a> i can conclude on these merit and demerit, first to talk of is that dev.pinuno.com.gh is a website under development,
		<br>development website meaning that this site is under construction, it can change anytime anyday since it is still being developed, every website should follow a set of standarad format,
                       the most important ones to find on the page includes
	        <ul>
	            <li> HOME</li>
	            <li> ABOUT</li>
	            <li> GALLERY</li><!--Consistency is very appreciated by developers, apply xhtml standards -->
	            <li> SERVICES</li>
	            <li> CONTACT</li>
	        </ul>
	        <p> These things are vital and must appear on every good webpage and these website clearly contains all the basic and important forms and pages that every good business website should possess, we realize that this website contains a header which has the website </p>
	            <ol>
	                <li> contact</li>
	                <li> About</li>
	                <li> what we do</li>
	            </ol>
				<p>Also a good business website should be Dynamic, Dynamic in the sense that the website should be able to display differents content to the user,basesd on some of these parameters;
	                <ul number>
	                    <li>What operating system or browser the visitor is using.</li>
	                    <li>Whether the user is using a computer or a mobile device.</li>
	                    <li>The source location that referred the visitor.</li>
	                    <li>If the visitor has done a purchase before from an online shop, etc.</li>
	                </ul> 
	                <br> DYNAMIC website is the latest trend used for developing a website/webpage for public consumption,
                            users might visit your site with a computer, a mobile phone, with a different browser and he/she should be able to access your website. looking at <strong>www.dev.pinuno.com.gh</strong>  
							is a website that is Dynamic in it sense which is good for a business, i tried to log in to these site with a mobile phone and was accessible without any problem. That is what we simply mean by dynamesim.<br>

<h3 align="center"> suggestions to improve <a href="http://dev.pinuno.comm.gh"> dev.pinuno.com.gh </a> website </h3>
<p>Dev.pinuno.com.gh is a website that is under development, which is subject to change almost every now and then. dev from the name of the website simply means DEVELOPMENT, which speaks for it self that the site is under construction. <br>
the website is accessible on all devices in other words the site is mobile friendly, but then i will suggest the following; 
<ul> <li> Social proof, we should have quote or sayings from folks who have used our product or acquire our service, this can be used to entice people to buy or hire our service if they need,also
that people can have confidence in us.</li>
<li> I suggest also that we should have a page of testimonies about client who have used our service.</li>
 <li>I suggest that there should be a page that invloves the team that makes up the company Pinuno Software, people would want to know and trust before doing business, and business is between people 
 so i think we should have a page of our team so that visitors can believe and do business with us.</li> <br />
 Also is what we called <b>call to Action</b> of which developers of this site makes use of this business terms 
 looking at dev so far, it very simple but contains all the required terms, actions and plans.<br />
 i see social share and follow buttons on this site, most of the things to talk about have been implimented, <br />
 Example using the right images, somethings images do not fit the type of message we are trying to show to our audience but this site <i> dev</i> complies to this. <br />
 Also to discuss is <b> Navigation,</b> navigation is very essential in pages, since it helps site visitors to easily navigate through the webpages, making way for <br />visitors 
to locate what they are looking for. 
we have tried to remove <b>Complicated animation</b> since sometimes those images detract from the value and message we are trying to convey.<br /> With audience that only has an
attention span of about few seconds, you have to create the impression that easily gets the main points across, i think this should be done with short, powerful <br /> section of the contents
and applicable photographys. and dev is on point with regards to this point.
<br />
<br />Few are the points of suggestions about the development of <a href="https://dev.pinuno.com.gh"> dev.pinuno.com.gh</a> which i have made known in the first 3 points from the begining. 
 </ul>

	<div class="column" style="background-color:lightblue">
		<p class="panorama"> <iframe src="http://pinuno.com.gh" height="619" width="759"frameborder="0" style="border:none"></iframe></p>
	</div>
	<div class="column" style="background-color:lightblue">
	<p id="pinuno.gh">  The website <a href="htttp://www.pinuno.com.gh">www.pinuno.com.gh </a> is a site that almost satisfies most of the requirment of a business website, particular it is 
    a simply website,it contians both footer and header,it also have links on the header describing what is does as a business, but
	each link do not respond to a click with the mouse, which indicate that this website is a <em>static</em> website.
    we say a site is static when the information is displayed within the same page of the site, beside, it usually written in plain HTML and what is in the
	code of the page is what is displayed to the user, which makes it sometimes easier to develop.
	<br /> But it requires expect to update it contents, also static website with the absence of 
    database makes the static site much more speedy and easy to load. we can say that a static site will load faster than a dynamic site, one reason 
    is that it can be served from the node/computer closest to the browser. according to research, about 47% of people expect website to load within 2 seconds 
    and about 40% of people will not wait for the website to load for longer than 3 seconds. Hence,getting a static website also helps in getting more traffic
    by reducing abandonment rate caused due to slow loading. We can also say that static website has inexpensive hosting, servers that are dedicated to this site are cheaper.
    Static website is also not good for long run: What it means is that it not an option for the long as any business would need to make a number of updates.<br /> 
 <br />In order to make changes,one would have to change each page file again and of course it's time consuming and take a lot of resources. We do know that static website does not offer all the functionalities<br />
   that a dynamic website can. One can add text, images, videos and hyperlinks in the content but other that, there are no other speacial functions that a static website can perform, as a result we can <br />
   not go beyound the functions that it comes with. Thinking that it must be dynamic because of this reasons;
 <br />
    Dynamic website is developed using advanced server technologies for example PHP, JavaScript or ASP. By dynamic we mean that the site is interactive in nature and changes according to time, geography and <br />
  and user type. Dynamic website can be connected to a large database enabling it to pull information as and when required. Let consider the following 
  <pre>
 1. Easy to update: one reason i suggest to dynamic website for pinuno.com.gh, it can be easily updatd as 
 per the needs of the business owner.
 2. interactive: Dynamic website interact with the user and changes according to behaviour 
 3. Quick to responsivesness: A dynamic website can be quick to update to become responsive to various
 screen size that was inpossible with static 
 4. Smooth navigation: A dynamic website offers a smooth navigation and lets the user jump from one page 
 to the other without any problem.
</pre>
  but then there is higher cost in their development and even the hosting cost is high, but once developed they would not cost additional money for any changes or updates
